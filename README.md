# Wavetable-Generator

The wavetableGenerator code was a small module written originally in python to aid in the production of wavetables to use in a wavetable synthesis implementation on a pic microcontroller.

The code in this repo has been modified to be more legible and more useful in a broader variety of applications, and you're free to use the resulting tables in any application you like without attribution; the code itself however, falls under the MIT license.

If you hope to use this software in a similar application as I have, or are interested in learning more about wavetable synthesis, the following links may provide some helpful information...
